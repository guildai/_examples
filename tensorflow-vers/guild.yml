    Workaround for Guild 0.6.3 and earlier on TensorFlow 2.x

    Versions of Guild prior to 0.6.4 did not support TensorFlow 2.x
    and would terminate with an error `AttributeError: module
    'tensorboard.summary._tf.summary' has no attribute 'FileWriter'`.

    This operation disables the plugins that rely on TensorFlow 1.x
    APIs and explicitly define the output scalars for step, loss, and
    accuracy that correspond to TF 2.0 Keras output.

    Update `output-scalars` as needed to capture scalars for your
    operation.

  main: beginner2
  disable-plugins: all
  output-scalars:
    step: 'Epoch (\S+)/'
    loss: '- loss: (\S+)'
    accuracy: '- accuracy: (\S+)'

summary1:
  main: summary1 ${logdir}
  flags:
    logdir:
      required: yes
      arg-skip: yes
  plugins: summary

summary2:
  main: summary2 ${logdir}
  flags:
    logdir:
      required: yes
      arg-skip: yes
  plugins: summary
