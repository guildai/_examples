# TensorFlow 2.0 example

This example defines [`beginner2.py`](beginner2.py), which corresponds
to the [TensorFlow 2.0 beginner
example](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/quickstart/beginner).

It also provides a Guild file ([`guild.yml`](guild.yml)) that works
around a problem with versions of Guild prior to 0.6.4.
