# Step 1. Operation named for your script
#
# You can alternatively name this `train` (drop the `.py` extension).
# In this case, you'd run `guild run train`.

train.py:

  # Step 2. List all of the scalars you want to capture
  #
  # This is a map of scalar key to regular expression.

  output-scalars:
    step: 'step: (\S+)'
    loss: 'loss: (\S+)'
    accuracy: 'accuracy: (\S+)'

  # Step 3. List the columns that you want to compare
  #
  # Note that flag names must be prefixed with '=' to
  # differentiate them from scalar keys.
  #
  # This is a painful step and unfortunately required in 0.6.1.
  # This will be fixed in 0.6.2 with a much less cumbersome
  # approach.

  compare:
    - =a
    - =b
    - loss step as step
    - loss
    - accuracy
