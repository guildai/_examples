# Guild Intro Example

This example shows a very simple Guild file that imports two flags
from a training script.

To run the operation, change to this directory and run:

    guild run train

Press `Enter` to train.

Of course it's a sample training operation - nothing is trained!

View the results using Guild compare:

    guild compare

Press `q` to exit compare.
