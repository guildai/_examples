# Guild Intro Example

This example shows a [simple Guild file](guild.yml) that imports two
flags from a [mock training script](train.py).

To run the operation, change to this directory and run:

    guild run train

Press `Enter` to train.

Of course it's a sample training operation - nothing is trained!

View the results using Guild compare:

    guild compare

Press `q` to exit compare.

You can also view the results in TensorBoard:

    guild tensorboard
