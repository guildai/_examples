      description:
        An experiment that explores the impact of dropout

        We find that dropout above 0.9 starts to negatively impacts
        learning. Dropout rates above 0.95 appear to be pathological,
        at least for short training runs.

        Use `guild compare 1:5 --table -cc =dropout,val_acc` to
        compare results after running experiment.
      steps:
        - run: train dropout=[0.7,0.8,0.9,0.95,0.99] epochs=1
