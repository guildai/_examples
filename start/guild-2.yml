# This is a variation of guild.yml that uses scalars logged by the
# Keras TensorBoard callback instead of the default scalars used by
# Guild, which are taken from the script output as it runs.
#
# In particular, the changes consist of:
#
# - Disable `output scalars` (the map of scalar keys to regular
#   expressions that is used capture scalar values from script output
#   by providing an empty map.
#
# - Redefine the `compare` (the list of column specs shown for to use
#   scalars logged by the Keras TensorBoard callback (the list of
#   available scalars for a run can be shown by running the `compare`
#   command with `--print-scalars` command line option.
#
# - Redefine the `objective` (the column spec used for either
#   maximizing or minizing during optimization) to use the valication
#   accuracy scalar.
#
# The net result of this change is to disable default scalar logging
# and rely solely on scalar logged by the script.
